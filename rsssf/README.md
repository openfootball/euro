What's changed? <br>
-  Start round lines with a round marker `▪`; optional - no need to UPCASE for emphasis
-  Enclose goal lines with parentheses, that is, `()` instead of square brackets `[]`
   - Move the goal minutes e.g. `22`, `42pen` after the player name 
-  Start geo names, that is,  city/location and ground/stadium/venue with
   the geo marker `@`
