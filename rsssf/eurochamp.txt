=European Championship, Finals=

# Has been played since 1960, originally as "Nations Cup".  
# From 1960 until 1976, 4 teams qualified for the final tournament, 
# from 1980 until 1992, 8 teams made it there, 
# and from 1996 to 2012 16 teams  entered the final showpiece.  
# Since 2016, 24 teams qualify for the final event. 
# However, 2020/21 saw a temporary return to the traditional format
# of 4 teams contesting the title at a single venue, in London,
# albeit after an additional second group phase and two knock-out rounds
# (the "Phase Platini")
# played all over Europe, in which six countries played all their group
# matches at home (Denmark, England, Germany, Italy,
# the Netherlands and Spain) while others were subjected to absurd travel trajectories.
