```
Has been played since 1960, originally as "Nations Cup".  
From 1960 until 1976, 4 teams qualified for the final tournament, 
from 1980 until 1992, 8 teams made it there, 
and from 1996 to 2012 16 teams entered the final showpiece.  
Since 2016, 24 teams qualify for the final event. 

However, 2020/21 saw a temporary return to the traditional format
of 4 teams contesting the title at a single venue, in London,
albeit after an additional second group phase and two knock-out rounds
(the "Phase Platini")
played all over Europe, in which six countries played all their group
matches at home (Denmark, England, Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands and Spain) while others were subjected to absurd travel trajectories.

### Special Score Lines (After Extra Time+Golden Goal/Silver Goal)

<!-- -->

- Golden Goal (1993 – 2004) -- Match ended immediately upon the first goal scored ("Sudden Death").
- Silver Goal (2002 – 2004) -- If a team led at the end of the first 15-minute half of extra time, they were declared the winner.
- Traditional ET (2004 – Present)	-- The full 30 minutes are played regardless of scoring.
